## Introduction
btcd-rpc-clientj is Java and Android library to call JSON-RPC API of the Bitcoind. There are these kinds of open source libraries like btcd-cli4j, BitcoindConnector4J, BitcoindClient4J. But They don't support JSON-RPC API methods perfectly and They are not up to date. The goal of this project is to support the whole methods listed in the ./bitcoind help-command and internally reduce the complexity of the source code for communicating with JSON RPC Server. Visit [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list) for more details about Original Bitcoin client/API calls list and [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29) for Bitcoin JSON-RPC calls. See [here](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob/en/stable/jsonrpc-example.html), if you want to know about JSON-RPC itself. Currently tested bitcoind version is 0.16.0.
