## Introduction
btcd-rpc-clientj is Java and Android library to call JSON-RPC API of the Bitcoind. There are these kinds of open source libraries like btcd-cli4j, BitcoindConnector4J, BitcoindClient4J. But They don't support JSON-RPC API methods perfectly and They are not up to date. The goal of this project is to support the whole methods listed in the ./bitcoind help-command and internally reduce the complexity of the source code for communicating with JSON RPC Server.
